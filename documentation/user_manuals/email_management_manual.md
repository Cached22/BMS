## Introduction

Welcome to the Email Management Module of our Business Management System (BMS). This module is designed to help you efficiently manage your email communications by integrating with Outlook, providing tracking features, and enabling you to prioritize your messages effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Email Management Module, ensure that you have completed the installation process using `installation/setup.py` and have navigated through the `installation/setup_wizard.html` to configure your email accounts.

## Features

### Email Tracking

The Email Management Module allows you to track when your emails are opened and read. Use the `trackEmail` function in `email_management/outlook_integration.py` to enable tracking for your sent emails.

### Reminders for Responses

Set reminders for emails that require follow-up. This feature ensures that you never miss responding to an important email. Reminders can be configured within the `email_dashboard.html` interface.

### Prioritization of Messages

Prioritize your messages by marking them as high, medium, or low priority. This helps you to focus on the most critical emails first. Prioritization settings can be adjusted in the `email_dashboard.js` script.

## Outlook Integration

The Email Management Module seamlessly integrates with Outlook. Ensure that you have provided the necessary `apiKeys` for Outlook in the `systemSettings` configuration.

## Navigating the Email Dashboard

The email dashboard is accessible through `email_dashboard.html`. It provides a clear visual representation of your inbox, with indicators for action items. Use the `#email-dashboard-container` to interact with the dashboard elements.
