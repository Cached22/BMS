## Introduction

Welcome to the Social Media Management module of our Business Management System (BMS). This module is designed to help you manage your business's presence across various social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and TikTok. With our unified dashboard, you can schedule posts, track engagement, and analyze your social media performance all in one place.

## Dashboard Overview

Access the Social Media Management dashboard by opening `social_media/dashboard.html` in your web browser. The dashboard is styled using `social_media/dashboard.css` and interactive elements are powered by `social_media/dashboard.js`.

### Unified Dashboard

The unified dashboard provides intuitive controls for each integrated social media platform. You can switch between different platforms using the tabs located at the top of the dashboard. The dashboard container can be identified by the DOM element with the ID `#dashboard-container`.

2. Click on the "Schedule Post" button.

The scheduling functionality is powered by the `schedulePost` function in the respective `social_media/*.py` files for each platform.

To view analytics:
