# Content Marketing User Manual

Welcome to the Content Marketing module of your Business Management System (BMS). This manual will guide you through the features and functionalities of the content marketing interface, designed to help you organize and schedule content across various platforms.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Content Marketing module, navigate to the `content_calendar.html` in your BMS dashboard. This interface is your central hub for creating, organizing, and scheduling your marketing content.

## Interface Overview

The Content Marketing Interface is divided into separate sections for each platform, with an integrated calendar view for scheduling. Here's what you'll find:

- **Content Calendar**: Access the calendar view by clicking on the `#content-calendar-container`. This is where you can schedule and view your content across different platforms.
- **Platform Sections**: Each social media platform has its own section within the interface, allowing you to tailor content specifically for that audience.

## Scheduling Content

To schedule content:

1. Select the platform you want to post to from the platform sections.
2. Click on the `scheduleContent` button.
3. Fill in the details of your content in the form that appears.
4. Choose the date and time for your content to go live.
5. Click 'Schedule' to add the content to your calendar.

The `content_interface.py` script will handle the scheduling logic, ensuring your content is posted at the specified times.

## Content Templates

For quick content creation, use the pre-designed templates available within the interface. Click on 'Use Template' in the respective platform section to get started.
